The goal of this command is to demonstrates the following functionality:

- Parameter and Argument return construction (no need to remember the string syntax anymore)
- Registration and installation of external address types (none of them use call, new, or discard)
- Adding new builtin functions that operate on external address types 
- How to install the new extensions without modifying the core clips source code
